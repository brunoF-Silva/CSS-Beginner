as p one an two haven't the position relative, span looks for body, in order to set its position*/

/* if we find, however, a prior ancestor with relative propertie elements, the abolute one will set its position related to it and then we can't cach it.  */

/* what i've stated before only applies to two or to div but not to one, because what really matters is just an actual ancestor, as two that comes right before span, or div which is its parent, but not one that's just its siblin */
