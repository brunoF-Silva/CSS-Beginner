the reason why we use rem:
if the user would like to change the font-size by changing the browser settings then the text using rem will also change (stretch or shrink) */

   -if we're gonna style something to relative to the root, we can go back to that rule and change these settings

   "font-size: 150% in :root and the responsive values (rem) are gonna change just as they change with the browser settings
